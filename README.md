ArduinoSketchbook
=================

All my Sketches and libs in one repo.

=== About ===

All these sketches (so far) as based upon the examples inside the Arduino packages.
I'm only modifying and adding things. 
Partly cause I want to learn arduino, partly cause I want to learn how to use git

=== Libraries ===

What I have done is to make the entire folder that the Arudino SDK points to, as one git repository.
This is due to the fact that the Arduino needs all libs there, no matter where they originate from.

As @daijo have done, by using avr-gcc and make files, is much cleaner and easier. But for now, my 
lack of knowledge prevents me from working like that. So I will keep on like this for the time being :-)
